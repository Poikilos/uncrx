CRX-Robber
==========

Download Chrome extension package, and extract into source files.



1) download crx files from chrome webstore
  There is no download button in chrome webstore. Althougth crx file is downloaded and saved to secret place, 
  it will be removed after installation. It is difficlut to fetch crx normally.
  I use a sniffer tool to capture http data packages during installing chrome extension, then analyse the 
  packages to find the url of crx file.
  
2) convey crx files to zip files
3) extract zip files
